# covid19berlin

This Flutter-Project is open to everybody who wants to contribute. The app will show covid-19 cases in Berlin at the Basis of the Robert-Koch-Institute Data. It will show the Hospitals and the Hotline where the User can get help if he fears to be infected. 

At the state now I used the following Plugins:
John Pryan's flutter_map 
https://github.com/johnpryan/flutter_map

and 
Munkh Altai's flutter_map_arcgis
