# covid19Berlin
 
 ## The App shows the daily cases of COVID-19 Infection in Berlin's districts. It shows hospitals. It has a Button that let the user immidiatly call Berlin's official Hotline.    
 
The App was built using Google's Mobile SDK [Flutter](https://www.fluter.dev).
As I am not a programmer but "just" an Digitalization Manager and Projectmanager with some Webdesign skills I used the awesome work of some talented Developer who developed awesome Flutter Plugins. 

I used John Pyron's [Flutter_Map](https://github.com/johnpryan/flutter_map) for a lightweighted Map.
I used Munk Altai's [Flutter_Map_Arcgis](https://github.com/munkh-altai/flutter_map_arcgis) which draws the polygon's from Esri's Robert-Koch-Institut [NPGEO Corona Hub](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/) to the map. 
Unfortunatly the plugin is in a very early development stage so I think I can't readout more ArcGis-Data from the API's featureset than the Polygones and Points I used. So perhaps I give a GeoJson Plugin a try which is in a higher developement stage.
