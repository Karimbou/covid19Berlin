# covid19Berlin
 
### The App will show the daily cases of COVID-19 Infection in Berlin's districts. It already shows hospitals and has a Button that let the user immidiatly call Berlin's official Hotline.    
 
The App was built using Google's Mobile SDK [Flutter](https://www.fluter.dev).

As I am not a programmer but "just" an Digitalization Manager and Projectmanager with some Webdesign skills I used the excelent work of some talented Developer who developed awesome Flutter Plugins. 

I used John Pyron's [Flutter_Map](https://github.com/johnpryan/flutter_map) for a lightweighted Map.

I also used Munkh Altai's [Flutter_Map_Arcgis](https://github.com/munkh-altai/flutter_map_arcgis) which draws the polygon's from Esri's Robert-Koch-Institut [NPGEO Corona Hub](https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/) to the map. 
Unfortunatly the plugin is in a very early development stage so I think I can't readout more ArcGis-Data from the API's featureset than the Polygones and Points I used. 

So perhaps I have to give a GeoJson Plugin a try which is in a higher developement stage. 

All the other plugins I used are: 

Mike Mitter's [LatLong](https://github.com/MikeMitterer/dart-latlong).
Jacob Araujo's [Responsive Container](https://github.com/jacobaraujo7/responsive_container).
Flutter's [Url Launcher](https://github.com/flutter/plugins).


I am learning much these days - but am sure I will not easily transformate to a (skilled) developer. But the COVID-Crisis needs quick help from those who can help. If you are a developer and want to participate in this project please send me a Note. I would be very happy if you could help out. 

Until now the App is just in an early MVP Stage

The App is now open sourced to all Cities who want to use it.
